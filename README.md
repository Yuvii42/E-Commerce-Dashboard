# E-Commerce-Dashboard

I'm thrilled to share my latest project that merges my love for statistics with data visualization!  💻📈

I've created an interactive dashboard using Power BI that allows for effective tracking and analysis of online sales data.

📊 The dashboard helps track and analyze online sales data effectively.
🔍 I explored advanced features like filters, slicers, and drill-down parameters for deeper insights.
🛠️ Learned how to create connections, join tables, and use dynamic calculations to make the data more user-friendly and actionable.
🎨 Experimented with various visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and maps to present the data in engaging ways.

This project has been an incredible learning experience, helping me refine my skills in analytics and storytelling through data. I'm excited to apply what I've learned to future endeavors! 🛣️ 

If you're passionate about data visualization and statistics, I’d love to connect!
